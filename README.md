# LeetCode C# Solutions

[![.NET](https://github.com/eremeeveugene/leetcode/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eremeeveugene/leetcode)

## Overview

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions, all implemented in C#. Each solution is implemented using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and follows the **AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert)** pattern. I start by writing the tests before diving into the actual code, ensuring the solutions meet expected outcomes and minimizing bugs. This method is perfect for tackling algorithmic challenges where precision is crucial.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to improve my own skills and demonstrate my capabilities. I am focused on my growth and learning by providing efficient and well-tested solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems.

## Technologies Used

- **[.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)**: The latest version of the .NET platform for building and running applications.
- **[C# 12](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-12)**: The programming language used to implement the solutions.
- **[MSTest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest)**: A testing framework for .NET to write and run tests.
- **[Coverlet](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet)**: A code coverage library for .NET that collects coverage data and integrates with build tasks.
- **[ReportGenerator](https://reportgenerator.io/)**: A tool to generate reports from the test coverage data.

## Tools

For developing and testing the solutions in this repository, I use the following tools:

- **[Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)**: The integrated development environment (IDE) where I write, debug, and run my C# code. It provides a comprehensive set of features for efficient coding and debugging, making it my go-to tool for .NET development.
- **[ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)**: A Visual Studio extension that enhances the development experience with advanced code analysis, refactoring tools, and productivity features. ReSharper helps me ensure my code is clean, optimized, and follows best practices.

## Time and Space Complexity

I analyze the time and space complexity using Big O notation for every algorithm solution in this repo. This analysis helps me understand each solution's efficiency and scalability.

## Automation Jobs

I've created automation jobs for this repository to streamline the development process. These jobs are defined in the `dotnet.yml` file and include steps for building the project, running tests with coverage, checking code style, and generating and uploading coverage reports. The jobs run on every push and pull request to the `develop` branch.
