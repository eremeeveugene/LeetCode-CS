# LeetCode C# Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode tasks, implemented in C#. You can check the latest build status via the badge below.

Each solution in this repository is developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD), an approach that involves writing tests before the actual functional code.
TDD helps ensure that the code meets the expected outcomes and reduces bugs, making it ideal for algorithmic challenges where precision is key.
